Good afternoon, interviewers, thank you for this opportunity.

My name is Zhang Zhenhong, and I am a junior from GCC majoring in Computer Science and Technology. 

I applied for this internship program not only because I want to work in computer-related jobs after graduation, but also because I am very interested in finance.

 My mathematical logic is not bad, and I believe I am fully prepared to learn more relevant knowledge required for the position.

In study life, I think that I have strong learning ability, pay attention to details, and am willing to accept feedback.

In daily life, I am a person who is full of energy and loves life. I like singing and cycling very much.

 I am proud that I once rode 290km in one day from Jieyang Jiedong to Shenzhen Pingshan.

Thank you again for giving me this opportunity. 

I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and officially become a member of the internship program, and fight side by side with the team in the future.
